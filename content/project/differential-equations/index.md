title: MATH 285 - Applied Differential Equations I
summary: Introduction to analytic and numerical methods for solving differential equations. Topics include numerical methods and qualitative behavior of first order equations, analytic techniques for separable and linear equations, applications to population models and motion problems; techniques for solving higher order linear differential equations with constant coefficients (including undetermined coefficients, reduction of order, and variation of parameters), applications to physical models; the Laplace transform (including intial value problems with discontinuous forcing functions). Use of mathematics software is an integral part of the course. Computing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course.
