bio: My research interests are in harmonic analysis, specifically weighted norm inequalities for singular integral operators and Riesz potentials in both the scalar and matrix setting. I am also interested in applications of Rubio de Francia extrapolation and in Bellman function techniques for proving sharp extimates.
interests:
  - Harmonic Analysis
  - Weighted Norm Inequalities
  - Bellman Function Techniques
  - Interpolation & Extrapolation
