abstract: We prove quantitative, one-weight, weak-type estimates for maximal operators, singular integrals, fractional maximal operators and fractional integral operators. We consider a kind of weak-type inequality that was first studied by Muckenhoupt and Wheeden and later by Cruz-Uribe, Martell and Perez. We obtain quantitative estimates for these operators in both the scalar and matrix weighted setting using sparse domination techniques. Our results extend those obtained by Cruz-Uribe, Isralowitz, Moen, Pott, and Rivera-RÃ­os for singular integrals and maximal operators when p=1.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
