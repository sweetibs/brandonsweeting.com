I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the analysis group at The University of Alabama working under the mentorship of [David Cruz-Uribe](https://math.ua.edu/people/david-cruz-uribe/). I received my doctorate degree from the University of Cincinnati in 2021 under the supervision of [Leonid Slavin](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/slavinld/).

My current research interests are in harmonic analysis–specifically, weighted norm inequalities for singular integral operators and Riesz potentials in both the scalar and operator weighted setting.
