bio: My research interests lie in harmonic analysis, where I specialize in the study of weighted norm inequalities for classical operators such as maximal functions, singular integrals, and Riesz potentials. I am interested in dyadic techniques for obtaining such estimates, including sparse domination and Bellman functions. I am also interested in the characterizations and structural properties of associated weight classes, their connections to geometry and PDE, and their extensions to other settings, such as matrix weights for vector-valued functions.

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the analysis group at The University of Alabama working under the mentorship of [David Cruz-Uribe](https://math.ua.edu/people/david-cruz-uribe/). I received my doctorate degree from the University of Cincinnati in 2021 under the supervision of [Leonid Slavin](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/slavinld/).

My research interests lie in harmonic analysis, where I specialize in the study of weighted norm inequalities for classical operators such as maximal functions, singular integrals, and Riesz potentials. I am interested in dyadic techniques for obtaining such estimates, including sparse domination and Bellman functions. I am also interested in the characterizations and structural properties of associated weight classes, their connections to geometry and PDE, and their extensions to other settings, such as matrix weights for vector-valued functions.
